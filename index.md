# introduce
Hello everyone welcome to my **stats220** website!
I am from the University of Auckland majoring in **data science**. I like to take risks and explore new thingsðŸ™Œ.
# About my image
The images I make are about Snoopy and it's always expressiveðŸ˜†. _That's my favorite cartoon._ Because Snoopy and his owner Charlie Brown always have a lot of fun happening. So I combined my life and studies to make images of him.
## My image(snoopy)
Below is my image. I made using the R package [{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html)
![snoopy](https://github.com/RuoqiZhang7/stats220/blob/main/snoopy.png)

_My inspiration came from my birthday last year, and I think Snoopy's picture can perfectly express the change of my mood_ðŸ˜Š.
