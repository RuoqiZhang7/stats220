# introduce
Hello everyone welcome to my stats220 website!
I am from the University of Auckland majoring in data science. I like to take risks and explore new things.
# About my image
The images I make are about Snoopy and it's always expressive. That's my favorite cartoon. Because Snoopy and his owner Charlie Brown always have a lot of fun happening. So I combined my life and studies to make images of him.
